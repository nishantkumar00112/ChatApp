# ChatApp
Real Time Chat Application 

In this project, we have created a real-time chat application designed to run on a local machine. The front-end webpage will request the user's name to identify the sender of messages. This webpage can be opened in multiple windows concurrently, allowing users to chat in real-time. When a message is sent from one window, it will be instantly displayed in all open windows. Essentially, this project simulates a real-time webpage accessible in multiple clients' web browsers, all connected to a shared server running on localhost.
